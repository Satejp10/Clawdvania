# Project log: Clawdvania

Append-only. Newest entries at the bottom. Never edit or delete a past entry;
corrections go in a new entry as `- correction: ...`.
One entry per working session. `/project-status` builds its reports from this file
plus live git facts, so anything not written here is likely to be lost.

Entry format:

## YYYY-MM-DD | session N | <cli | web | desktop>
- did: <what actually changed>
- decided: <decision> because <reason>
- rejected: <alternative> because <reason>
- broke/fixed: <symptom, and resolution if any>
- open: <unresolved question>

## 2026-08-01 | session 1 | web
- did: bootstrapped this log and generated the first status report,
  `.claude/context/reports/SR-clawdvania-001.md`. No log or prior report existed, so
  project history before 2026-07-28 is reconstructed from git, `AUDIT.md`, `README.md`
  and the code, and is tagged `[inferred]` in the report.
- did: verified current state rather than asserting it — headless Chromium boot of
  `index.html` reaches the title state with zero page errors; the GitHub Pages build is
  byte-for-byte identical to local `index.html` (72352 bytes both); working tree clean;
  repo is 5 tracked files with no build, no tests and no CI.
- decided: keep `docs/screenshot.png` as a full-colour PNG (532KB) rather than a
  256-colour one (198KB) because quantising shifts 11% of pixels with a peak error of 51,
  and that error lands in the dusk gradient the image exists to show off.
- decided: capture the README screenshot at 1536x864 — exactly 3x the 512x288 design
  space — because an integer scale maps every sprite pixel to a clean 3x3 block, while
  the fractional scale used at arbitrary window sizes leaves Clawd with a ragged outline
  in a still image.
- decided: add `CLAUDE.md` to the repo because the response format and the verification
  practices were evaporating with each ephemeral cloud session.
- rejected: converting reference GIFs to mp4 for analysis, because video cannot be read
  at all whereas GIF frames and their per-frame timing can be extracted directly.
- broke/fixed: nothing broken this session. Confirmed the earlier duplicated wall-jump
  sound fix is still in place and that all three jump kinds own their own sound.
- open: whether Clawdvania stays a five-minute vignette or grows; whether "one file,
  zero assets" is a hard rule or a convenience; what else besides combat it must never
  become; and who the audience is.
- open: the wall cling and double jump remain decorative — a reachability search shows
  the double jump stands on exactly the same nine surface rows as no double jump. This
  is level design, not a defect.
- next: replace the sprite system's single scalar `fps` per pose set with per-frame
  durations. Uneven holds are currently inexpressible by construction, which blocks
  every queued animation improvement.
